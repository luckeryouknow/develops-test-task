This is test task for DevelopsToday.
## Getting Started

First, run this command to ensue that all modules are installed:

```bash
npm install
```

Then you can start an apllications with: 
```bash
npm run dev
```

## About project

There are those folders: 
- app(standart one) with pages inside;
- components with reusable components inside of it;
- constants(some variables that will be reused);
- types to make typization for project(mostly for work with api).

## Why i didn't use env
In my opinion, there's no variables that should be stored inside of the env configuration. There's
no db or other stuff like this.
